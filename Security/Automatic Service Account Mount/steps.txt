1- if you create a simple pod
note that we dont spicify any service account or secret 
but when you descripe the pod details you can see a mounted volume 
for example 
    Mounts:
      /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount from kube-api-access-hn5km (ro)

if u go inside the pod and see the content of the directory you will see a file called "token"

view the content of the token file you will see the token this pod use to conatct the other components internally.
