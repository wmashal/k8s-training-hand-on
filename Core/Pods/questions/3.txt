what the command I should write to list the pods like the following?

NAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx           1/1     Running   0          27s
newpods-5lv5l   1/1     Running   0          18s
newpods-bsfhx   1/1     Running   0          18s
newpods-cklm9   1/1     Running   0          18s
