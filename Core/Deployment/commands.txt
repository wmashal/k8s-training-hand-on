Follow the steps given below to update your Deployment:

Let's update the nginx Pods to use the nginx:1.16.1 image instead of the nginx:1.14.2 image.

kubectl set image deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1

or use the following command:

kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1

The output is similar to:
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment image updated
Alternatively, you can edit the Deployment and change .spec.template.spec.containers[0].image from nginx:1.14.2 to nginx:1.16.1:

kubectl edit deployment/nginx-deployment

The output is similar to:

deployment.apps/nginx-deployment edited
To see the rollout status, run:

kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment

The output is similar to this:

Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
or

deployment "nginx-deployment" successfully rolled out

kubectl describe deployments

Suppose that you made a typo while updating the Deployment, by putting the image name as nginx:1.161 instead of nginx:1.16.1

Checking Rollout History of a Deployment
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.161 


kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment


Now you've decided to undo the current rollout and rollback to the previous revision:

kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment

kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment --to-revision=2

Scaling a Deployment 

kubectl scale deployment/nginx-deployment --replicas=10
