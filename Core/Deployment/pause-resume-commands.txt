When you update a Deployment, or plan to, you can pause rollouts for 
that Deployment before you trigger one or more updates. When you're ready to apply those changes, 
you resume rollouts for the Deployment. This approach allows you to 
apply multiple fixes in between pausing and resuming without triggering unnecessary rollouts.

For example, with a Deployment that was created:

Get the Deployment details:

kubectl get deploy
The output is similar to this:

NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx     3         3         3            3           1m
Get the rollout status:

kubectl get rs
The output is similar to this:

NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
nginx-2142116321   3         3         3         1m
Pause by running the following command:

kubectl rollout pause deployment/nginx-deployment
The output is similar to this:

deployment.apps/nginx-deployment paused
Then update the image of the Deployment:

kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1
The output is similar to this:

deployment.apps/nginx-deployment image updated
Notice that no new rollout started:

kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
The output is similar to this:

deployments "nginx"
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1   <none>
Get the rollout status to verify that the existing ReplicaSet has not changed:

kubectl get rs
The output is similar to this:

NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
nginx-2142116321   3         3         3         2m
You can make as many updates as you wish, for example, update the resources that will be used:

kubectl set resources deployment/nginx-deployment -c=nginx --limits=cpu=200m,memory=512Mi
The output is similar to this:

deployment.apps/nginx-deployment resource requirements updated
The initial state of the Deployment prior to pausing its rollout will continue its function, but new updates to the Deployment will not have any effect as long as the Deployment rollout is paused.

Eventually, resume the Deployment rollout and observe a new ReplicaSet coming up with all the new updates:

kubectl rollout resume deployment/nginx-deployment
The output is similar to this:

deployment.apps/nginx-deployment resumed
Watch the status of the rollout until it's done.

kubectl get rs -w
