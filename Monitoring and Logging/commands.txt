To install the metrics server you can apply the deployment file form the repository 

kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metricsserver/releases/latest/download/components.yaml

Once deployed, give the metrics-server some time to collect and process data. Once processed, cluster performance can be viewed by running the command

Kubectl top node


kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/debug/counter-pod.yaml
kubectl logs counter

You can use 

kubectl logs --previous 

to retrieve logs from a previous instantiation of a container.

If your pod has multiple containers, specify which container's logs you want to access

kubectl logs counter -c count
